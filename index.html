    <h2 class= "center"> A little bit about me... </h2>
    <img id=right src ="/assets/me.jpg" alt= "me at the Shuri castle in Naha, Japan">
    <p> Born and raised in Houston, Texas, I'm a fan of southern
      hospitality and eating at BBQ joints on road trips. As a freshman at Dartmouth College, I
      plan to major in Economics and Computer Science and minor in French.
      <br /> 
      <br /> 
      On campus, I co-direct SHEBA Dance Troupe, Wild Things Dance Workshops, and I"m the treasurer of Sigma
      Delt. I have also been involved in the Sustainability Office and DALI Lab. 
      <br /> 
      Past Involvements: 
      Rassias Center  
      Donald J. Claflin Jewelry Studio 
      Allen House Cube Manager 
      DIPP lol

      to get food or watch Studio Ghibli movies so we can be friends!!  </p>

    <h2 class="center">Other interests!</h2>
    <p class="center">Below are some of the other things I do unrelated to Dartmouth</p>

    <h3 class="center">Dancing</h3>
    <p class="center">Right now, I mostly do hiphop and urban dancing; however, I have a background in
      modern, Chinese and Taiwanese cultural dancing, jazz, and a little bit of ballet. I want to
      learn to ballroom dance one day (in search of someone to learn with me)!
      <br>
      <br>
      Somehow, I'm also certified as a Zumba instructor.

    <h3 class="center">Traveling</h3>
    <p class="center">Here are some videos from my most recent trips! *Videos have recently been made private*

      My sister and I used to make sock animals and tried to make a business
      out of it (the business never took off, but this is where I got my
      sewing skills from). The website still exists
