    <h2 class= "center"> A little bit about me... </h2>
    <img id=right src ="/assets/me.jpg" alt= "me at the Shuri castle in Naha, Japan">
    <p> Born and raised in Houston, Texas, I'm a fan of southern
      hospitality and eating at BBQ joints on road trips. As a freshman at Dartmouth College, I
      plan to major in Economics and Computer Science and minor in French.
      My interest in the tech world didnâ€™t pick up until the end of high school
      senior year in which I started to learn Python on my own and found that I
      liked the problem-solving aspect of coding and being able to make the computer
      output my ideas into something real. Having been an appendix of DALI from the
      WISP internship, I hope to be able to continue learning and growing from
      other DALI members and from the resources provided. DALI has helped me gain exposure
      and experience to developing iOS apps, and I love the atmosphere of the group and space.
      As a personal goal, even though I'm a developer, I'd also like to become a better
      designer, and DALI has already helped push me out of my comfort zone in design to improve. </p>

    <p class-"center">Anyways, this site is just a snapshot of me, so introduce yourself next time and ask
      to get food or watch Studio Ghibli movies so we can be friends!!  </p>

    <h2 class="center">Other interests!</h2>
    <p class="center">Below are some fun things I do when I'm not coding...</p>

    <h3 class="center">Dancing</h3>
    <p class="center">Right now, I mostly do hiphop and urban dancing; however, I have a background in
      modern, Chinese cultural dancing, jazz, and a little bit of ballet. I want to
      learn to ballroom dance one day (in search of someone to learn with me)!
      <br>
      <br>
      Somehow, I'm also certified as a Zumba instructor.

      something cool)! Here are some old and recent projects

      My sister and I used to make sock animals and tried to make a business
      out of it (the business never took off, but this is where I got my
      sewing skills from). The website still exists
      <a href ="http://ajlhandicrafts.blogspot.com/" target = "_blank">here</a>!
